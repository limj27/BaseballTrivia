Elite Nine

* Client
- Simple web UI for now but want to add mobile functionality (iOS & Android)

* Backend
- Websocket REST API Golang server to handle real-time gameplay
- Using Docker for ease of deployment on a Raspberry Pi
- Database to store trivia questions
- Using Redis to store session cache

Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure

Set up your local development environment

Install Go, Docker, Docker Compose
Configure your IDE/code editor
Create a Git repository for version control


Create the basic directory structure
baseball-trivia/
├── server/           # Go backend code
│   ├── cmd/          # Application entry points
│   ├── internal/     # Private application code
│   ├── models/       # Data models
│   ├── handlers/     # HTTP and WebSocket handlers
│   ├── database/     # Database access layer
│   └── Dockerfile    # For containerizing Go app
├── nginx/
│   └── conf.d/       # NGINX configuration
├── init-scripts/     # Database initialization scripts
├── static/           # Static assets
├── .env.example      # Environment variables template
└── docker-compose.yml

Set up Docker Compose environment

Create the Docker Compose file (like the one I provided)
Create Dockerfile for the Go application
Configure environment variables



Phase 2: Core Components Development

Database design and setup

Create SQL schema for users, questions, game history
Write database initialization scripts
Implement Go database interface layer


Build authentication system

Implement user registration and login
Set up session management with Redis
Create authentication middleware


Develop game state management

Implement the game models (similar to what I provided)
Create game management logic
Build question retrieval and scoring system


Implement WebSocket handlers

Set up WebSocket server
Implement connection management
Create message handling system
Develop game state synchronization



Phase 3: Game Logic & Features

Develop game logic

Question selection algorithm
Answer validation
Scoring system
Game flow (rounds, timers, etc.)


Build frontend interface

Create HTML/CSS/JS for the client
Implement WebSocket client
Design UI for game lobby, questions, leaderboard


Add game features

Multiple game rooms
Different question categories
Difficulty levels
Leaderboards



Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

Implement testing

Unit tests for game logic
Integration tests for WebSocket communication
Load testing (simulate multiple players)


Set up CI/CD pipeline

Automate testing
Configure Docker image building
Set up deployment workflow


Deployment

Test Docker Compose setup on staging server
Configure production environment
Deploy to production server



Phase 5: Scaling & Enhancements

Implement monitoring and logging

Set up application logs
Configure metrics collection
Create monitoring dashboards


Optimize for scale

Refine load balancing
Add horizontal scaling capability
Implement caching strategies


Add advanced features

User profiles and stats
Achievements system
Tournament mode
